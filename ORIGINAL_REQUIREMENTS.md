# Original Functional Requirements

This file contains the original functional requirements that were specified in `requirements.txt` before it was updated to contain Python package dependencies.

## Original Requirements.txt Content

```
Create an Agentic AI trading bot using Python, Alpaca, and Azure Open AI that trades based on the rules described in rules.json.

Analysis Agent:
1. Read the trading rules from `rules.json`.
2. Get historical data for each pic and calculate the technical indicators that are described in rules.json
3. Store that data and pass it to the other agents

News Agent:
1. Call newsapi and gather any recent news on the tickers and score it

Master Agent:
1. Take the data from Analysis and News agents
2. Create a strong prompt as an expert swing trader do the tech analysis describe in rules.json and combine that with news data and make descision wether to buy, sell or hold
2. Connect to the Alpaca API using the provided credentials.
3. Implement the trading logic based on the description field.
4. If multiple rules apply, the rule with highest priority should be executed.
5. Execute trades based on the signals generated by the rules.
6. Log all trades and signals to a file.
7. Handle errors and exceptions gracefully.
8. Send out an email in table format for each pick with Buy, Sell, Hold and reason
```

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Fully Implemented** - All original requirements have been implemented in the codebase:

- **Analysis Agent**: Implemented in `src/agents/analysis_agent.py`
- **News Agent**: Implemented in `src/agents/news_agent.py` 
- **Master Agent**: Implemented in `src/agents/master_agent.py`
- **Trading Rules**: Parsed from `rules.json` and implemented in `src/utils/technical_indicators.py`
- **Alpaca API Integration**: Implemented throughout the agents
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system in `src/utils/logger.py`
- **Email Notifications**: HTML table format emails in `src/utils/email_sender.py`
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling throughout the system

## File Purpose

- `requirements.txt` - Contains Python package dependencies needed to run the bot
- `ORIGINAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Contains the original functional requirements (this file)
- `README.md` - Contains comprehensive documentation and usage instructions
- `rules.json` - Contains the specific trading rules and configurations
